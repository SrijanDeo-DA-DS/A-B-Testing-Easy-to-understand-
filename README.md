# A-B-Testing-Easy-to-understand-
Conducted A/B testing on an e-commerce data to see if a new page helped convert more customers or the old one was better.

1. The data consists of two groups 'control' and 'treatment'.
2. 'Control' group is shown the old page of a website and conversion rate is measured.
3. 'Treatment' group is shown the new page of the same website and conversion rate is calculated.
4. Null and Alternate hypothesis is formulated and p value is measured.
5. Using A/B test statistics, Null hypothesis is either accepted or rejected.
